# Challenge CFM

This repo contains my Codes and Datasets for the CMF challenge : EPrediction of the direction of a share's price over the last two hours of trading.

> ranking :

The US equity market is one of the most liquid in the world, providing a wealth of investment opportunities. The last two hours of the session, between 2pm and 4pm, are the most liquid of all.

This is the best time to buy or sell a large quantity of assets, because market conditions are better (lower transaction costs, lower volatility, etc.). This is why estimating the behaviour of an asset over this period in advance enables you to optimise your portfolio as a whole.  

The aim of this challenge is to estimate the direction of a share's price over the last two hours of trading, knowing how it behaved at the start of the day.

To avoid the usual noise of financial movements, we consider only three directions:

* a sharp fall in price ;
* a minor change in either direction; or
* a sharp rise in price.
