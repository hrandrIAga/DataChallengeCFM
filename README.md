# DataChallengeCFM
The aim of this challenge is to estimate the direction of a share's price over the last two hours of trading, knowing how it behaved at the start of the day.  To avoid the usual noise of financial movements, we consider only three directions:  * a sharp fall in price ; * a minor change in either direction; or * a sharp rise in price.
